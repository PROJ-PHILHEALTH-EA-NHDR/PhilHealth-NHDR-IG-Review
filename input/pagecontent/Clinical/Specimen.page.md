# {{page-title}}

A sample to be used for analysis.

## Scope and Usage

Any material sample:

- taken from a biological entity, living or dead
- taken from a physical object or the environment

Some specimens are biological and can contain one or more components including but not limited to cellular molecules, cells, tissues, organs, body fluids, embryos, and body excretory products (source: NCI Thesaurus icon, modified).

The specimen resource covers substances used for diagnostic and environmental testing. The focus of the specimen resource is the process for gathering, maintaining and processing the specimen as well as where the specimen originated. This is distinct from the use of Substance which is only used when these other aspects are not relevant.

## Notes
- These parameters are case-sensitive as per FHIR's rules.
- Additional custom search parameters may be defined depending on the implementation.
- Some parameters allow modifiers (e.g., `:exact`, `:contains`) for more advanced queries.
- Replace `[base]` with your FHIR server's base URL when constructing API calls.
