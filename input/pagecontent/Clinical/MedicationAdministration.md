# {{page-title}}

Describes the event of a patient consuming or otherwise being administered a medication. This may be as simple as swallowing a tablet or it may be a long running infusion. Related resources tie this event to the authorizing prescription, and the specific encounter between patient and health care practitioner.

## Scope and Usage

This resource covers the administration of all medications. Please refer to the Immunization resource/Profile for the treatment of vaccines. It will principally be used within care settings (including inpatient) to record medication administrations, including self-administrations of oral medications, injections, intravenous infusions, etc. It can also be used in outpatient settings to record allergy shots and other non-immunization administrations. In some cases, it might be used for home-health reporting, such as recording self-administered or even device-administered insulin.

Note: devices coated with a medication (e.g. heparin) are not typically recorded as a medication administration. However, administration of a medication via an implanted medication pump (e.g., insulin) would be recorded as a MedicationAdministration.

This resource can also be used for recording waste by setting the status to 'not-done' and the statusReason to a code that refers to waste. The remaining fields would support the waste elements, i.e. performer of the waste, quantity of medication wasted, date/time of waste, etc. It is also possible, using the partOf reference to a MedicationDispense, to indicate that this waste occurred as part of a dispense event.
