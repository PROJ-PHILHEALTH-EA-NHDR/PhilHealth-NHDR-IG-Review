# {{page-title}}


A structured set of questions and their answers. The questions are ordered and grouped into coherent subsets, corresponding to the structure of the grouping of the questionnaire being responded to.

## Scope and Usage

QuestionnaireResponse provides a complete or partial list of answers to a set of questions filled when responding to a questionnaire. The questions may be included directly or by reference to a Questionnaire resource that defines the questions as well as the constraints on the allowed answers. In some cases, both formal rules for editing the questionnaire (via link to Questionnaire) as well as sufficient local information to allow rendering of the questionnaire may be provided.

Each time a questionnaire is completed for a different subject or at a different time, a distinct QuestionnaireResponse is generated, though it may be possible for a previously entered set of answers to be edited or updated.

Questionnaire responses cover the need to communicate data originating from forms used in medical history examinations, research questionnaires and sometimes full clinical specialty records. In many systems this data is collected using user-defined screens and forms. Questionnaire responses record specifics about data capture - exactly what questions were asked, in what order, what answers were given, etc. Each of these questions is part of the Questionnaire, and as such the Questionnaire is a separately identifiable Resource, whereas the individual questions are not.

Examples of Questionnaires include:

- Past medical history (PMH)
- Family diseases
- Social history
- Research questionnaires and Case report forms (CRFs)
- Quality and evaluation forms
- Patient intake form (e.g. clipboard)
- Insurance claim form

QuestionnaireResponse resources can be validated against their corresponding Questionnaire to verify that required groups and questions are answered and that answers fit constraints in terms of cardinality, data type, etc.
