# {{page-title}}

Details and position information for a place where services are provided and resources and participants may be stored, found, contained, or accommodated.


## Scope and Usage

A Location includes both incidental locations (a place which is used for healthcare without prior designation or authorization) and dedicated, formally appointed locations. Locations may be private, public, mobile or fixed and scale from small freezers to full hospital buildings or parking garages.

Examples of Locations are:

- Building, ward, corridor, room or bed
- Mobile Clinic
- Freezer, incubator
- Vehicle or lift
- Home, shed, or a garage
- Road, parking place, a park
- Ambulance (generic)
- Ambulance (specific)
- Patient's Home (generic)
- Jurisdiction

These locations are not intended to cover locations on a patient where something occurred (i.e. a patient's broken leg), but can happily cover the location where the patient broke the leg (the playground)

## Notes
- These parameters are case-sensitive as per FHIR's rules.
- Additional custom search parameters may be defined depending on the implementation.
- Some parameters allow modifiers (e.g., `:exact`, `:contains`) for more advanced queries.
- Replace `[base]` with your FHIR server's base URL when constructing API calls.
