The following are the extensions utilized in the **PHCDI Implementation Guide**. These extensions represent additional elements or concepts that are not covered by the standard core resources provided by HL7 FHIR. Extensions are used to customize the FHIR standard to address specific requirements or use cases that are unique to an implementation, without compromising the base FHIR model's interoperability or structure. 

Extensions are typically designed and implemented to cater to the particular needs of a health data exchange, such as those outlined by the **Philippine Health Data Interoperability Framework**, ensuring the inclusion of essential localized or contextual information. These elements are defined outside of the core FHIR specification and adhere to strict guidelines to maintain consistency and compatibility with existing FHIR standards.

In the case of the PHCDI Implementation Guide, these extensions allow for the representation of country-specific data elements, regulatory requirements, or business rules that are critical for achieving the national health data repository's objectives, while still leveraging the global FHIR framework for data interoperability.
